# Sustainability-for-Future

**Module Overview:**
This module will introduce students to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), linking each goal to core scientific concepts. Through this module, students will learn how scientific knowledge and technological innovation contribute to solving global challenges such as climate change, poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

**Unit 1: Environmental Sustainability (SDGs 6, 7, 13, 14, 15)**


**SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy**

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

_Targets_

By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
services.

By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global
energy mix

By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support.


Lack of access to energy supplies and transformation systems is a constraint to human and economic development. The environment provides a series of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources i.e. solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, biofuels, natural gas, coal, petroleum and uranium. Increased use of fossil fuels without actions to mitigate greenhouse gases will have global climate change implications. Energy efficiency and increase use of renewables contribute to climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction.
Maintaining and protecting ecosystems allow using and further developing hydropower sources of electricity and bioenergy.


**Unit 2: Social Sustainability (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16)**


**SDG 1: No Poverty**

Sustainable Development Goal 1 is to end poverty in all forms and everywhere by 2030.

_Targets_

Eradicate extreme poverty.

Reduce poverty by at least 50%.

Implement a nationally appropriate social protection system.

Equal rights to ownership , basic services , technology, and economic resources.

Build resilience to environment, economic, and social disasters.


Poverty is a main issue that has troubled many nations while impeding economic developments. Poverty is a problem that faced every where in the world. in some nations the percentage of peoples affecting poverty is more as compare to other nations. poverty is discussed in terms of money, quality of life etc… The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed some of the progress made in reducing poverty. By the end of 2022, it was estimated that 670 million people, or 8.4% of the world's population, were still living in extreme poverty.

**SDG 2: Zero Hunger**

Sustainable Development Goal 2 is about creating a world free of hunger by 2030.

_Targets_

Ensure that everyone has access to safe, nutritious food.

End all forms of malnutrition, including stunting and wasting in children under five.

Double the income and productivity of small-scale food producers.

Ensure a sustainable food production system.

Promote resilient agricultural practices.


The global issue of hunger and food insecurity has shown an alarming increase since 2015, a trend exacerbated by a combination of factors including the pandemic, conflict, climate change, and deepening inequalities.
Main points are
• Keep our soil and water clean.
• Use less water can’t waste it.
• Know where your food comes from.
• Understand food labeling.
• Be a conscientious consumer.
• Support the farmers. 

**SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**

Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages.

_Targets_

Reduce maternal mortality.

End all preventable deaths under five years of age.

Fight communicable diseases.

Reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health.

Prevent and treat substance abuse.


Good health and well-being aspire to ensure health and well-being for all, including a bold commitment to end the epidemics of aids, tuberculosis, malaria, and other communicable disease by 2030. Universal health coverage: providing universal health coverage.Research and development: increasing research and development. Health risk management: strengthening the capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management. It also aims to achieve universal health coverage and provide access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines for all.

**SDG 10: Reduced Inequality**

Sustainable Development Goal 10 aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
 
_Targets_
  
Inequality can be based on factors like age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic status. 
  
Inequality can be based on factors like representation, migration, and development assistance.
  
Targets for SDG 10 include eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices, and adopting policies to achieve greater equality. 
  

When we talk about Reducing Inequality, it's really about making sure everyone has the same opportunities to succeed, no matter who they are or where they come from. In the classroom, this could mean discussing what inequality looks like—why some people face more challenges based on things like income, gender, or background—and brainstorming ways to help level the playing field. Students can dive into real-world examples of governments and organizations working to reduce these gaps, and even create their own initiatives to promote equality in their school or community. Imagine starting a peer tutoring program to help kids from underprivileged backgrounds, or organizing a campaign that raises awareness about discrimination. It’s about empowering students to see that they can be part of the solution.




**Unit 3: Economic Sustainability (SDGs 8, 9, 11, 12, 17)**


**SDG 8:Decent Work And Economic Growth**

Sustainable Development Goal 8 is a United Nations goal to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all.

_Targets_
 
Eliminating the worst forms of child labor by 2025.

Eradicating forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking.

Strengthening the capacity of domestic financial institutions.


Over the past 25 years, the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined
dramatically, despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In
developing countries, the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of total
employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015.
However, as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth, widening
inequalities, and not enough jobs to keep up with a growing labour force. According to the
International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015.
The SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity and technological
innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this, as are effective
measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind,
the goal is to achieve full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women and men
by 2030.

**SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure**

Sustainable Development Goal 9 is the goal to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.

_Targets_

Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.

Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries.

Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets.

By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities.


Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies. Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development. More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and entrepreneurship.


**SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**

The Global GoalsSDG 11, or Sustainable Development Goal 11, is a United Nations goal to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

_Targets_
  
Transportation
  
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transportation systems for all.
  
Housing and basic services
  
By 2030, ensure access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services.
  
By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible, green and public spaces. 


 Sustainable Cities are all about making our neighborhoods and cities places where everyone can live happily and healthily without harming the environment. In classes like geography or environmental science, students can explore how smart urban planning can make cities more livable—think parks, clean air, and public transport that reduces traffic. As part of a project, they might design their own ideas for a sustainable city or take a walk around their community to figure out how things could be better, like improving recycling or adding green spaces. Outside the classroom, they could lead a clean-up in the local park or start a school garden, showing them firsthand that small actions can make a big difference in creating a better, more sustainable community.

**SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, also known as Responsible Consumption and Production, is about making changes to consumption and production patterns to help the environment. The goal is to ensure that the planet's resources are used sustainably to support current and future generations.

_Targets_

Reduce the use of natural resources and toxic materials

Reduce waste and pollution 

Promote resource and energy efficiency 

Provide access to basic services, green jobs, and a better quality of life 


 Learning about Responsible Consumption and Production helps students think about how the choices we make—what we buy, how we use things, and how we get rid of them—impact the world. In subjects like economics or business, students could explore how companies are finding creative ways to reduce waste, use less energy, or make products that are better for the environment. But it’s not just businesses; students can make changes, too. In home economics or practical lessons, they might tackle food waste in the cafeteria or create cool projects from recycled materials. Schools could even run a “zero-waste” challenge, encouraging students to bring reusable containers and cut down on single-use plastics. It’s about showing students that being mindful of what we use and how we use it can help protect the planet for the future.
