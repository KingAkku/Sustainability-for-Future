**SDG 10: Reduced Inequality**

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
 
_Targets_
  
Inequality can be based on factors like age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic status. 
  
Inequality can be based on factors like representation, migration, and development assistance.
  
Targets for SDG 10 include eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices, and adopting policies to achieve greater equality. 
  

When we talk about Reducing Inequality, it's really about making sure everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from, has the same opportunities to succeed. In the classroom, this could mean discussing what inequality looks like—why some people face more challenges based on things like income, gender, or background—and brainstorming ways to help level the playing field. Students can dive into real-world examples of governments and organizations working to reduce these gaps, and even create their own initiatives to promote equality in their school or community. Imagine starting a peer tutoring program to help kids from underprivileged backgrounds, or organizing a campaign that raises awareness about discrimination. It’s about empowering students to see that they can be part of the solution.

**SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**

The Global GoalsSDG 11, or Sustainable Development Goal 11, is a United Nations goal to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

_Targets_
  
Transportation
  
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transportation systems for all.
  
Housing and basic services
  
By 2030, ensure access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services.
  
By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces. 


 Sustainable Cities are all about making our neighborhoods and cities places where everyone can live happily and healthily without harming the environment. In classes like geography or environmental science, students can explore how smart urban planning can make cities more livable—think parks, clean air, and public transport that reduces traffic. As part of a project, they might design their own ideas for a sustainable city or take a walk around their community to figure out how things could be better, like improving recycling or adding green spaces. Outside the classroom, they could lead a clean-up in the local park or start a school garden, showing them firsthand that small actions can make a big difference in creating a better, more sustainable community.

**SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**
  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, also known as Responsible Consumption and Production, is about making changes to consumption and production patterns to help the environment. The goal is to ensure that the planet's resources are used sustainably to support current and future generations.

_Targets_

Reduce the use of natural resources and toxic materials

Reduce waste and pollution 

Promote resource and energy efficiency 

Provide access to basic services, green jobs, and a better quality of life 


 Learning about Responsible Consumption and Production helps students think about how the choices we make—what we buy, how we use things, and how we get rid of them—impact the world. In subjects like economics or business, students could explore how companies are finding creative ways to reduce waste, use less energy, or make products that are better for the environment. But it’s not just businesses; students can make changes, too. In home economics or practical lessons, they might tackle food waste in the cafeteria or create cool projects from recycled materials. Schools could even run a “zero-waste” challenge, encouraging students to bring reusable containers and cut down on single-use plastics. It’s about showing students that being mindful of what we use and how we use it can help protect the planet for the future.
