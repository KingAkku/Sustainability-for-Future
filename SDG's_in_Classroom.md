# Sustainability-for-Future

**Module Overview :**
This module will introduce students to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), linking each goal to core scientific concepts. Through this module, students will learn how scientific knowledge and technological innovation contribute to solving global challenges such as climate change, poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

**Unit 1: Environmental Sustainability (SDGs 6, 7, 13, 14, 15)**

**SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**

Sustainable Development Goal 6 is a United Nations goal to ensure that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation.

_Targets_

By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.

By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.

By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.

By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.

By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.


Sustainable Development Goal 6 declares the importance of achieving "clean water and sanitation for all". The goal has eight targets to be achieved by 2030 covering the main areas of water supply and sanitation and sustainable water resource management. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven indicators. The six key outcome targets are to Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. Achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. Improve water quality, by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater (wastewater treatment) and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. Substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity. Implement integrated water resources management (IWRM), at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate. Protect and restore water-related ecosystems including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.


**SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy**

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

_Targets_

By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
services.

By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global
energy mix

By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programs of support.


Lack of access to energy supplies and transformation systems is a constraint to human and economic development. The environment provides a series of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources i.e. solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, biofuels, natural gas, coal, petroleum and uranium. Increased use of fossil fuels without actions to mitigate greenhouse gases will have global climate change implications. Energy efficiency and increase use of renewables contribute to climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction.
Maintaining and protecting ecosystems allow using and further developing hydropower sources of electricity and bioenergy.

**SDG 13: Climate Action**

Sustainable Development Goal 13 is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

_Targets_

Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.

Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning.

Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible

Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth, and local and marginalized communities.


The key goal of SDG 13 is to take urgent action on climate change to end it and its dangerous impacts. This is because the presence of climatic change is ranked to become among the greatest threats to human societies at their current day-to-day actions today, affecting the ecosystems economies, and livelihoods all around the world. This would also result in frequent extreme weather conditions, increases in sea level, and habitations further destroyed. Some of the key objectives for SDG 13 include building resilience and adaptive
capacity to climate-related hazards, integrating climate change concerns into national policies and planning, and strengthening education for sustainable development in fostering resource-efficient, sustainable lifestyles, and renewable energies.

**SDG 14: Life Below Water**

Sustainable Development Goal 14 is about the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources.

_Targets_

By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.

By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.

Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.

By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.

By 2020, conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.

Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets.


The SDG 14 is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Oceans occupy over 70% of the Earth's surface and give us life on Earth. Through their management, they afford the opportunity to ensure at least some 'balance of global climate', provide oxygen, and represent the vital source of food and livelihoods for millions of inhabitants. More key priorities by the implementation of SDG 14 include: eliminating and reducing marine pollution significantly, mainly caused by land-based activities such as plastics; conserving effective marine and coastal ecosystems so as not to cause significant adverse changes; and ending overfishing while bringing an end to IUU fishing.

**SDG 15: Life on Land**

Sustainable Development Goal 15, also known as "Life on Land", aims to protect and sustainably use terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands.

_Targets_

Ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.

By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.

By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought, and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world.

Ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.

Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.


The SDG 15 focuses on sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, and halting biodiversity loss. The earth's forests cover about 31% of the planet's land, provide essential ecosystem services, and are home to more than 80% of all terrestrial species of animals, plants, and insects. Yet, forests are under pressure from illegal logging, land conversion to agriculture, and unsustainable management practices. Moreover, desertification, the degradation of arid and semi-arid land, affects over 2 billion people, with some of the most vulnerable regions being Africa and Asia.

The main goal are:

Combat desertification.

Halt and reverse land degradation.

Halt biodiversity loss.

Conserve mountain ecosystems.

Protect threatened species.

Promote fair sharing of genetic resources.


**Unit 2: Social Sustainability (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16)**


**SDG 1: No Poverty**

Sustainable Development Goal 1 is to end poverty in all forms and everywhere by 2030.

_Targets_

Eradicate extreme poverty.

Reduce poverty by at least 50%.

Implement a nationally appropriate social protection system.

Equal rights to ownership , basic services , technology, and economic resources.

Build resilience to environment, economic, and social disasters.


Poverty is a main issue that has troubled many nations while impeding economic developments. Poverty is a problem that faced every where in the world. in some nations the percentage of peoples affecting poverty is more as compare to other nations. poverty is discussed in terms of money, quality of life etc… The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed some of the progress made in reducing poverty. By the end of 2022, it was estimated that 670 million people, or 8.4% of the world's population, were still living in extreme poverty.

**SDG 2: Zero Hunger**

Sustainable Development Goal 2 is about creating a world free of hunger by 2030.

_Targets_

Ensure that everyone has access to safe, nutritious food.

End all forms of malnutrition, including stunting and wasting in children under five.

Double the income and productivity of small-scale food producers.

Ensure a sustainable food production system.

Universal health coverage: providing universal health coverage.Research and development: increasing research and development. Health risk management: strengthening the capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management. It also aims to achieve universal health coverage and provide access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines for all.

**SDG 4: Quality Education**

Sustainable Development Goal 4 is the United Nations' goal to ensure quality education for all and promote lifelong learning.

_Targets_

By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and Goal-4 effective learning outcomes.

By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and preprimary education so that they are ready for primary education.

By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university.

By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.

By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations.

By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.


The main aims are:

Ensure that all children complete free primary and secondary school by 2030.

Provide equal access to affordable vocational training.

Eliminate gender and wealth disparities.

Achieve universal access to quality higher education.

Ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development.

**SDG 5: Gender Equality**

Sustainable Development Goal 5 is the goal to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

_Targets_

End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.

Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.

Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.

Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate.

Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.

Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels.


Gender equality  Sustainable Development Goal 5  concerns gender equality and is the fifth of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The 17 SDGs recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. SSG5 aims to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls everywhere. Ending violence and exploitation of women and girls. Eliminating harmful practices such as child early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. Increasing the value of unpaid care and promoting shared domestic responsibilities.ensuring full participation of women in leadership and decision-making. Ensuring access to universal reproductive rights and health. The three means of implementation are fostering equal rights to economic resources, property ownership, and financial services for women. Promoting empowerment of women through technology. Adopting and strengthening policies for gender equality, and supporting legislation to enforce it.

**SDG 10: Reduced Inequality**

Sustainable Development Goal 10 aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
 
_Targets_
  
Inequality can be based on factors like age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic status. 
  
Inequality can be based on factors like representation, migration, and development assistance.
  
Targets for SDG 10 include eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices, and adopting policies to achieve greater equality. 
  

When we talk about Reducing Inequality, it's really about making sure everyone has the same opportunities to succeed, no matter who they are or where they come from. In the classroom, this could mean discussing what inequality looks like—why some people face more challenges based on things like income, gender, or background—and brainstorming ways to help level the playing field. Students can dive into real-world examples of governments and organizations working to reduce these gaps, and even create their own initiatives to promote equality in their school or community. Imagine starting a peer tutoring program to help kids from underprivileged backgrounds, or organizing a campaign that raises awareness about discrimination. It’s about empowering students to see that they can be part of the solution.

**SDG 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions**

Sustainable Development Goal 16 is about promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

_Targets_

Reduce violence everywhere.

Protect children from abuse, exploitation, trafficking and violence.

Equal access to justice.

Combat organized crime and illicit financial and arms flows.

Substantially reduce corruption and bribery.

Develop effective, accountable, and transparent institutions.

Ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making.

Strengthen the participation in global governance.

Provide universal legal identity.

Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms.

One cannot underestimate the importance of SDG 16 as the goal aims to address issues of peace, justice, and strong institutions which are fundamental to any healthy and just society. In their absence, people cannot be expected to feel protected, respectful towards their leaders, or trust in the mechanisms that are designed to shield them. By implementing SDG 16, we can be able to build societies where every citizen gets the chance to prosper and live without fear. This goal assists other SDGs as well. For instance, if the levels of violence are lowered, more resources and attention can be directed toward education, health care, and even economic development. SDG 16 is geared towards the creation of a more just and tolerant world for all.


**Unit 3: Economic Sustainability (SDGs 8, 9, 11, 12, 17)**


**SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth**

Sustainable Development Goal 8 is a United Nations goal to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all.

_Targets_
 
Eliminating the worst forms of child labor by 2025.

Eradicating forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking.

Strengthening the capacity of domestic financial institutions.


Over the past 25 years, the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined
dramatically, despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In
developing countries, the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of total
employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015.
However, as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth, widening
inequalities, and not enough jobs to keep up with a growing labour force. According to the
International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015.
The SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity and technological
innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this, as are effective
measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind,
the goal is to achieve full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women and men
by 2030.

**SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure**

Sustainable Development Goal 9 is the goal to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.

_Targets_

Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.

Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries.

Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets.

By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities.


Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies. Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development. More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and entrepreneurship.


**SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**

The Global GoalsSDG 11, or Sustainable Development Goal 11, is a United Nations goal to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

_Targets_
  
Transportation
  
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transportation systems for all.
  
Housing and basic services
  
By 2030, ensure access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services.
  
By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible, green and public spaces. 


 Sustainable Cities are all about making our neighborhoods and cities places where everyone can live happily and healthily without harming the environment. In classes like geography or environmental science, students can explore how smart urban planning can make cities more livable—think parks, clean air, and public transport that reduces traffic. As part of a project, they might design their own ideas for a sustainable city or take a walk around their community to figure out how things could be better, like improving recycling or adding green spaces. Outside the classroom, they could lead a clean-up in the local park or start a school garden, showing them firsthand that small actions can make a big difference in creating a better, more sustainable community.

**SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, also known as Responsible Consumption and Production, is about making changes to consumption and production patterns to help the environment. The goal is to ensure that the planet's resources are used sustainably to support current and future generations.

_Targets_

Reduce the use of natural resources and toxic materials

Reduce waste and pollution 

Promote resource and energy efficiency 

Provide access to basic services, green jobs, and a better quality of life 


 Learning about Responsible Consumption and Production helps students think about how the choices we make—what we buy, how we use things, and how we get rid of them—impact the world. In subjects like economics or business, students could explore how companies are finding creative ways to reduce waste, use less energy, or make products that are better for the environment. But it’s not just businesses; students can make changes, too. In home economics or practical lessons, they might tackle food waste in the cafeteria or create cool projects from recycled materials. Schools could even run a “zero-waste” challenge, encouraging students to bring reusable containers and cut down on single-use plastics. It’s about showing students that being mindful of what we use and how we use it can help protect the planet for the future.

**SDG 17: Partnership to Achieve the Goal**

Sustainable Development Goal 17 calls on Member States to significantly enhance the availability of reliable, high-quality and timely disaggregated data as well as to further develop measurements of progress, and support statistical capacity building in developing countries.

_Targets_

Mobilize resources to improve domestic revenue collection.

Implement all development assistance commitments.

Mobilize financial resources for developing countries.

Assist developing countries in attaining debt sustainability.

Invest in least-developed countries.

Knowledge sharing and cooperation for access to science, technology and innovation.

Promote sustainable technologies to developing countries.

Strengthen the science, technology and innovation capacity for least-developed countries.

Enhanced SDG capacity in developing countries.

Promote a universal trading system under the WTO.

Increase the exports of developing countries.
 

Development Goal seventeen focuses on building synergies and partnerships between governments, businesses as well as organizations for the purpose of enhancing all sdgs, including sdg 16. This means that no country or organization can achieve these global goals by itself a collaborative approach is very important. This means working together within local, national, and international systems in order to mitigate the impediments to sustainable development in terms of resources, information, and assistance.
